# travel tracker

## Setup

The details and setup of this project are outline in [this project spec](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/travel-tracker.html).

## Overview:

Travel tracker is an app lets a user keep track of their trips, with clean displays for past, present, upcoming and all trips. Additionally, a user can book their own trip. A quote can be calculated before booking, and the app also displays total spent on trips for the current calendar year. 

## Goals:

- Implement OOP and ES6 classes.
- Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation
- Create a user interface that is clean and easy to use.
- Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
- Implement a robust testing suite using TDD
- Make network requests to retrieve and post data
- Ensure the app follows best practices for accessibility


## Tech used:
- JavaScript
- Mocha
- Chai
- CSS
- HTML

## Challenges:
- Planning and implementing class structure
- Making the website accessible, especially for tabbing.

## Wins:
- Successfully using fetch API to get and post data.
- Reconfiguring the app to be accessible.
- Using parameters and arguments as well as iterators and helper functions to build DRY code that follows SRP.


## Testing:
Mocha and chai as well as Chrome Dev Tools
